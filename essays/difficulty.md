*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

One of my friends asked me a compelling question earlier last week: why is it so challenging to transition from an intern to a full-time officer for the student branch? Why does it seem more demanding than my on-campus job? This question arose after he faced some difficulties with bookkeeping for the student organization.

Initially, I provided him with the standard answer - being an officer of an organization demands effective time management between school and work, with no one explicitly guiding you. It's a response any good mentor would give, and it holds truth.

However, as I pondered more, I found myself thinking, "Damn, that's a really great question that deserves more thought." Most people, I believe, stop at the answer I initially provided - implying the struggle is due to poor time management.

Here's what I think: the journey from intern to a full-time software engineer at Fyle, or any similar transition, will always be challenging.

## In the context of programming

In the realm of programming, this truth has endured. The challenges may shift with changes in technology, but difficult problems persist. Applications with a "business" focus, inherently intertwined with people, pose significant challenges. Dealing with people is inherently complex!

Consider the popularity of Wordpress, despite its reputation. If building such content management systems were easy, where is the perfect solution? Where's the CMS that seamlessly caters to everyone's needs?

Some things are just inherently difficult - constructing applications for human use is hard and likely to remain so in the foreseeable future.

## In the context of engineering

Have you ever heard criticisms of engineering companies for delivering projects late and significantly over budget? Some engineering jobs are genuinely difficult, especially when the requirements and funding fluctuate. Complex problems sometimes demand a large workforce, leading to additional challenges and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project, for example, has become a symbol of failure, budget overruns, and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Navigating regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems mind-bogglingly challenging. While there might be questionable aspects, not everyone involved is likely doing so for nefarious reasons.

Creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is a daunting task! Even with the best minds, it's uncertain whether we would have succeeded.

## In the context of relationships

Ultimately, engineering and programming exist to serve human needs. Perhaps that's why these areas are challenging - they involve humans and cater to humans.

Relationships, whether romantic or not, require effort. Humans are unpredictable, and relationships can be transient. Sustaining something over time demands continuous work. Family necessitates work. Marriage demands work. We live to discern what works and what doesn't, hoping to improve as we progress.

Relationships have always been difficult and will continue to be so by nature.

## Okay!

Returning to the original question - why is transitioning from an intern to a club officer so challenging?

The ultimate answer - it's meant to be challenging. It's designed to test and push you, just like every other human endeavor that is challenging: programming, engineering, relationships, contemplating the universe, and more.

When faced with something particularly difficult, the crucial question to ask yourself is, "Is it worth it?" This is context-specific, and only you can determine the answer.
