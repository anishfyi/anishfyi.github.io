*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

One of my friends asked me a compelling question earlier last week: why is it so challenging to transition from an intern to a full-time software engineer at a startup.

Here's what I think: the journey from being an intern to a full-time software engineer.

## In the context of engineering

New Feature Development: Took on the responsibility of crafting a brand-new feature. Leveraged the power of Angular for the frontend and Django for the backend. This involved not only coding but also understanding the intricacies of integrating these technologies seamlessly.

Cypress End to End Test: Started the journey by diving into Cypress for end-to-end testing. It was both exciting and challenging to ensure that the application functions seamlessly from the user's perspective.

Parity Features: Didn't stop at just one feature. Added multiple parity features to enhance the overall user experience. This required a deep understanding of the existing codebase and ensuring that the new additions align perfectly with the established standards.

Bug Fixing Across Integrations: Faced the inevitable bugs that come with integration. Debugging and fixing issues across different software integrations demanded attention to detail and a systematic approach.

Integration Support: Moved beyond just writing code to provide support for integrations. This involved working closely with other teams to troubleshoot issues, ensuring a smooth collaboration between different parts of the system.


## In the context of relationships

Ticket Resolutions: Engaged in resolving multiple tickets. This wasn't just about fixing technical problems; it was also about building relationships with team members and stakeholders. Clear communication and collaboration were key in addressing and closing these tickets.

## Okay!

So, the journey from intern to a full-time software engineer involved not just technical skills but also a holistic understanding of the development process, effective communication, and collaboration. It's a challenging but rewarding path that shapes not just your coding skills but your overall approach to problem-solving and teamwork.
